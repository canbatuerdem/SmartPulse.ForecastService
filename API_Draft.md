## Code / API Draft

The assignment explicitly requests an example service with a minimum of
two endpoints. This requirement is fully satisfied through the running
ASP.NET Core API included in this solution. All implemented endpoints,
request/response models, and example payloads can be interactively
explored and tested via the built-in Swagger UI after startup:

http://localhost:8080/swagger

This provides a live, executable API draft instead of static code
snippets, ensuring that both behavior and contracts can be directly
validated.
